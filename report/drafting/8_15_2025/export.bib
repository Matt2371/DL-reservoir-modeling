   abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunk-ing, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

   abstract = {The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision is mainly driven by their strong inductive bias, which is strong enough to allow CNNs to solve vision-related tasks with random weights, meaning without learning. Similarly, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has a strong inductive bias towards storing information over time. However, many real-world systems are governed by conservation laws, which lead to the redistribution of particular quantities -- e.g. in physical and economical systems. Our novel Mass-Conserving LSTM (MC-LSTM) adheres to these conservation laws by extending the inductive bias of LSTM to model the redistribution of those stored quantities. MC-LSTMs set a new state-of-the-art for neural arithmetic units at learning arithmetic operations, such as addition tasks, which have a strong conservation law, as the sum is constant over time. Further, MC-LSTM is applied to traffic forecasting, modelling a pendulum, and a large benchmark dataset in hydrology, where it sets a new state-of-the-art for predicting peak flows. In the hydrology example, we show that MC-LSTM states correlate with real-world processes and are therefore interpretable.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a special type of recurrent neural network. The advantage of the LSTM is its ability to learn long-term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network, which are essential for modelling storage effects in e.g. catchments with snow influence. We use 241 catchments of the freely available CAMELS data set to test our approach and also compare the results to the well-known Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA) coupled with the Snow-17 snow routine. We also show the potential of the LSTM as a regional hydrological model in which one model predicts the discharge for a variety of catchments. In our last experiment, we show the possibility to transfer process understanding, learned at regional scale, to individual catchments and thereby increasing model performance when compared to a LSTM trained only on the data of single catchments. Using this approach, we were able to achieve better model performance as the SAC-SMA+Snow-17, which underlines the potential of the LSTM for hydrological modelling applications.},

   abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has played an increasing role in the hydrological sciences. In particular, certain types of time series modeling strategies are popular for rainfall-runoff modeling. A large majority of studies that use this type of model do not follow best practices, and there is one mistake in particular that is common: training deep learning models on small, homogeneous data sets (i.e., data from one or a small number of watersheds). In this position paper, we show that Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) streamflow models are best when trained with a large amount of hydrologically diverse data. 5 1 Machine learning requires different intuitions about hydrological modeling Regionalizing rainfall-runoff models across multiple watersheds is a longstanding problem in the hydrological sciences (Guo et al., 2021). The most accurate streamflow predictions from conceptual and process-based hydrological models generally require calibration to long data records in individual watersheds. Hydrology models based on machine learning (ML) are different-ML models work best when trained on data from many watersheds (Nearing et al., 2021). In fact, this is one of the 10 main benefits of ML-based streamflow modeling. Because ML models are trained with data from multiple watersheds, they are able to learn hydrologically diverse rainfall-runoff responses (Kratzert et al., 2019b) in a way that is useful for example for prediction in ungauged basins (Kratzert et al., 2019a). Prediction in ungauged basins is not the only reason to train ML models on data from many watersheds. Models trained this way have better skill even in individual, gauged watersheds with long training data records (Nearing et al., 2021), and they are 15 also better at predicting extreme events (Frame et al., 2022). The purpose of this position paper is to suggest a change in intuition. ML requires a top-down modeling approach, in contrast to traditional hydrological modeling that is usually most effective with a bottom-up approach. We do not mean top-down vs. bottom-up in the sense discussed by Hrachowitz and Clark (2017). Instead, we mean that traditional hydrology models (both lumped conceptual models and process-based models) are typically developed, calibrated, and verified at a local scale, ideally 20 using long and comprehensive data records from experimental watersheds. Then, in the bottom-up approach, after a model is developed, we might work on regionalization strategies to extrapolate parameters and parameterizations to larger areas (e.g., Samaniego et al., 2010; Beck et al., 2016). With ML modeling, the best approach is to start by training on all available data from 1 https://doi.},

All of the data are provided at a daily temporal resolution. Temporal coverage varies by reservoir depending on construction date and digital data availability. Overall, the data spans from 1930 to 2020, although the best coverage is for the most recent years, particularly 1980 to 2020.

The problem currently is that traditional hydrological models degrade significantly in performance when calibrated for multiple basins together instead of for a single basin alone. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate that under a "big data" paradigm, this is not necessarily the case. By training a single LSTM model on 531 basins from the CAMELS dataset using meteorological time series data and static catchment attributes, we were able to significantly improve performance compared to a set of several different hydrological benchmark models. Our proposed approach not only significantly outperforms hydrological models that were calibrated regionally, but also achieves better performance than hydrological models that were calibrated for each basin individually. Furthermore, we propose an adaption to the standard LSTM architecture, which we call an Entity-Aware-LSTM (EA-LSTM), that allows for learning catchment similarities as a feature layer in a deep learning model. We show that these learned catchment similarities correspond well to what we would expect from prior hydrological understanding.},

Using a continuous time analysis, we gain intuition on the inner workings of GRU networks. We restrict our presentation to low dimensions, allowing for a comprehensive visualization. We found a surprisingly rich repertoire of dynamical features that includes stable limit cycles (nonlinear oscillations), multi-stable dynamics with various topologies, and homoclinic bifurcations. At the same time we were unable to train GRU networks to produce continuous attractors, which are hypothesized to exist in biological neural networks.

   abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated the ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) machine-learning-based modeling to outperform traditional spatially lumped process-based modeling approaches for streamflow prediction. However, due mainly to the structural complexity of the LSTM network (which includes gating operations and sequential processing of the data), difficulties can arise when interpreting the internal processes and weights in the model. Here, we propose and test a modification of LSTM architecture that is calibrated in a manner that is analogous to a hydrological system. Our architecture, called "HydroLSTM", simulates the sequential updating of the Markovian storage while the gating operation has access to historical information. Specifically, we modify how data are fed to the new representation to facilitate simultaneous access to past lagged inputs and consolidated information, which explicitly acknowledges the importance of trends and patterns in the data. We compare the performance of the HydroLSTM and LSTM architectures using data from 10 hydro-climatically varied catchments. We further examine how the new architecture exploits the information in lagged inputs, for 588 catchments across the USA. The HydroLSTM-based models require fewer cell states to obtain similar performance to their LSTM-based counterparts. Further, the weight patterns associated with lagged input variables are interpretable and consistent with regional hydroclimatic characteristics (snowmelt-dominated, recent rainfall-dominated, and historical rainfall-dominated). These findings illustrate how the hydrological interpretability of LSTM-based models can be enhanced by appropriate architectural modifications that are physically and conceptually consistent with our understanding of the system.},

   abstract = {A large fraction of major waterways have dams influencing streamflow, which must be accounted for in large-scale hydrologic modeling. However, daily streamflow prediction for basins with dams is challenging for various modeling approaches, especially at large scales. Here we examined which types of dammed basins could be well represented by long short-term memory (LSTM) models using readily-available information, and delineated the remaining challenges. We analyzed data from 3557 basins (83% dammed) over the contiguous United States and noted strong impacts of reservoir purposes, degree of regulation (dor), and diversion on streamflow modeling. While a model trained on a widely-used reference-basin dataset performed poorly for non-reference basins, the model trained on the whole dataset presented a median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.74. The zero-dor, small-dor (with storage of approximately a month of average streamflow or less), and large-dor basins were found to have distinct behaviors, so migrating models between categories yielded catastrophic results, which means we must not treat small-dor basins as reference ones. However, training with pooled data from different sets yielded optimal median NSEs of 0.72, 0.79, and 0.64 for these respective groups, noticeably stronger than existing models. These results support a coherent modeling strategy where smaller dams (storing about a month of average streamflow or less) are modeled implicitly as part of basin rainfall-runoff processes; then, large-dor reservoirs of certain types can be represented explicitly. However, dammed basins must be present in the training dataset. Future work should examine separate modeling of large reservoirs for fire protection and irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and flood control.},

Despite this, somewhat paradoxically, neural network models trained via first-order methods continue to predict well on yet unseen test data. This paper takes a step towards demystifying this phenomena. Under a rich dataset model, we show that gradient descent is provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels despite overparameterization. In particular, we prove that: (i) In the first few iterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization gradient descent only fits to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy labels. (ii) to start to overfit to the noisy labels network must stray rather far from from the initialization which can only occur after many more iterations. Together, these results show that gradient descent with early stopping is provably robust to label noise and shed light on the empirical robustness of deep networks as well as commonly adopted heuristics to prevent overfitting.},

   abstract = {Building reservoir release schedules to manage engineered river systems can involve costly trade-offs between storing and releasing water. As a result, the design of release schedules requires metrics that quantify the benefit and damages created by releases to the downstream ecosystem. Such metrics should support making operational decisions under uncertain hydrologic conditions, including drought and flood seasons. This study addresses this need and develops a reservoir operation rule structure and method to maximize downstream environmental benefit while meeting human water demands. The result is a general approach for hedging downstream environmental objectives. A multistage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program with Markov Chains, identifies optimal “environmental hedging,” releases to maximize environmental benefits subject to probabilistic seasonal hydrologic conditions, current, past, and future environmental demand, human water supply needs, infrastructure limitations, population dynamics, drought storage protection, and the river's carrying capacity. Environmental hedging “hedges bets” for drought by reducing releases for fish, sometimes intentionally killing some fish early to reduce the likelihood of large fish kills and storage crises later. This approach is applied to Folsom reservoir in California to support survival of fall-run Chinook salmon in the lower American River for a range of carryover and initial storage cases. Benefit is measured in terms of fish survival; maintaining self-sustaining native fish populations is a significant indicator of ecosystem function. Environmental hedging meets human demand and outperforms other operating rules, including the current Folsom operating strategy, based on metrics of fish extirpation and water supply reliability.},

   abstract = {The state of the art for optimal water reservoir operations is rapidly evolving, driven by emerging societal challenges. Changing values for balancing environmental resources, multisectoral human system pressures, and more frequent climate extremes are increasing the complexity of operational decision making. Today, reservoir operations benefit from technological advances, including improved monitoring and forecasting systems as well as increasing computational power. Past research in this area has largely focused on improving solution algorithms within the limits of the available computational power, using simplified problem formulations that can misrepresent important systemic complexities and intersectoral interactions. In this study, we review the recent literature focusing on how the operation design problem is formulated, rather than solved, to address existing challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper contributes a comprehensive classification of over 300 studies published over the last years into distinctive categories depending on the adopted problem formulation, which clarifies consolidated methodological approaches and emerging trends. Our analysis also suggests that control policy design methods may benefit from broadening the types of information that is used to condition operational decisions, and from using emulation modeling to identify low-order, computationally efficient surrogate models capturing realistic representations of river basin systems' complexity in order to isolate key decision-relevant processes. These advances in reservoir operations hold significant promise for better addressing the challenges of conflicting human pressures and a changing world, which is particularly important, given the renewed interest in dam construction globally.},

   abstract = {Globally, many different kinds of water resources management issues call for policy- and infrastructure-based responses. Yet responsible decision-making about water resources management raises a fundamental challenge for hydrologists: making predictions about water resources on decadal- to century-long timescales. Obtaining insight into hydrologic futures over 100 yr timescales forces researchers to address internal and exogenous changes in the properties of hydrologic systems. To do this, new hydrologic research must identify, describe and model feedbacks between water and other changing, coupled environmental subsystems. These models must be constrained to yield useful insights, despite the many likely sources of uncertainty in their predictions. Chief among these uncertainties are the impacts of the increasing role of human intervention in the global water cycle - a defining challenge for hydrology in the Anthropocene. Here we present a research agenda that proposes a suite of strategies to address these challenges from the perspectives of hydrologic science research. The research agenda focuses on the development of co-evolutionary hydrologic modeling to explore coupling across systems, and to address the implications of this coupling on the long-time behavior of the coupled systems. Three research directions support the development of these models: hydrologic reconstruction, comparative hydrology and model-data learning. These strategies focus on understanding hydrologic processes and feedbacks over long timescales, across many locations, and through strategic coupling of observational and model data in specific systems. We highlight the value of use-inspired and team-based science that is motivated by real-world hydrologic problems but targets improvements in fundamental understanding to support decision-making and management. Fully realizing the potential of this approach will ultimately require detailed integration of social science and physical science understanding of water systems, and is a priority for the developing field of sociohydrology.},

   abstract = {As an important anthropogenic interference in the hydrologic cycle, reservoir operation behavior remains challenging to be properly represented in hydrologic models, thus limiting the capability of predicting streamflow under the interactions between hydrologic variability and operational preferences. Data-driven models provide a promising approach to capture relationships embedded in historical records. Similar to hydrologic processes that vary across temporal scales, reservoir operations manifest themselves at different timescales, prioritizing different operation targets to mitigate streamflow variability at a given time scale. To capture the interaction of reservoir operation across time scales, we proposed a hierarchical temporal scale framework to investigate the behaviors of over 300 major reservoirs across the Contiguous United States with a wide range of streamflow conditions. Data-driven models were constructed to simulate reservoir releases at monthly, weekly, and daily scales, where decisions at short-term scales interact with long-term decisions. We found that the hierarchical temporal scale configuration could compensate for the absence of key explanatory variables as model inputs, thereby efficiently capturing the release decisions of reservoirs situated in the west. Model-based sensitivity analysis shows that for more than one-third of the studied reservoirs, the release schemes, as a function of decision variables, vary at different time scales, suggesting that operators commonly face complicated trade-offs to serve multiple designed purposes. The proposed hierarchical temporal scale approach is flexible to incorporate various data-driven models and decision variables to derive reservoir operation rules, providing a robust framework to understand the feedback between natural streamflow variability and human interferences across time scales.},

   abstract = {The controlled outflows from a reservoir or dam are highly dependent on the decisions made by the reservoir operators, instead of a natural hydrological process. Difference exists between the natural upstream inflows to reservoirs and the controlled outflows from reservoirs that supply the downstream users. With the decision maker's awareness of changing climate, reservoir management requires adaptable means to incorporate more information into decision making, such as water delivery requirement, environmental constraints, dry/wet conditions, etc. In this paper, a robust reservoir outflow simulation model is presented, which incorporates one of the well-developed data-mining models (Classification and Regression Tree) to predict the complicated human-controlled reservoir outflows and extract the reservoir operation patterns. A shuffled cross-validation approach is further implemented to improve CART's predictive performance. An application study of nine major reservoirs in California is carried out. Results produced by the enhanced CART, original CART, and random forest are compared with observation. The statistical measurements show that the enhanced CART and random forest overperform the CART control run in general, and the enhanced CART algorithm gives a better predictive performance over random forest in simulating the peak flows. The results also show that the proposed model is able to consistently and reasonably predict the expert release decisions. Experiments indicate that the release operation in the Oroville Lake is significantly dominated by SWP allocation amount and reservoirs with low elevation are more sensitive to inflow amount than others.},

   abstract = {<p>During the past decades, the increased impact of anthropogenic interventions on river basins has prompted hydrologists to develop various approaches for representing human-water interactions in large-scale hydrological and land surface models. The simulation of water reservoir storage and operations has received particular attention, owing to the ubiquitous presence of dams. Yet, little is known about (1) the effect of the representation of water reservoirs on the parameterization of hydrological models, and, therefore, (2) the risks associated with potential flaws in the calibration process. To fill in this gap, we contribute a computational framework based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which we use to calibrate VIC's parameters. An important feature of our framework is a novel variant of VIC's routing model that allows us to simulate the storage dynamics of water reservoirs. Using the upper Mekong river basin as a case study, we calibrate two instances of VIC - with and without reservoirs. We show that both model instances have the same accuracy in reproducing daily discharges (over the period 1996-2005), a result attained by the model without reservoirs by adopting a parameterization that compensates for the absence of these infrastructures. The first implication of this flawed parameter estimation stands in a poor representation of key hydrological processes, such as surface runoff, infiltration, and baseflow. To further demonstrate the risks associated with the use of such a model, we carry out a climate change impact assessment (for the period 2050-2060), for which we use precipitation and temperature data retrieved from five global circulation models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). Results show that the two model instances (with and without reservoirs) provide different projections of the minimum, maximum, and average monthly discharges. These results are consistent across both RCPs. Overall, our study reinforces the message about the correct representation of human-water interactions in large-scale hydrological models.</p>.},

As the changes in the water cycle on land can affect the functioning of a wide range of biophysical and biogeochemical processes of the Earth system, it is essential to represent human land–water management in Earth system models (ESMs). During the recent past, noteworthy progress has been made in large-scale modeling of human impacts on the water cycle but sufficient advancements have not yet been made in integrating the newly developed schemes into ESMs. This study reviews the progresses made in incorporating human factors in large-scale hydrological models and their integration into ESMs. The study focuses primarily on the recent advancements and existing challenges in incorporating human impacts in global land surface models (LSMs) as a way forward to the development of ESMs with humans as integral components, but a brief review of global hydrological models (GHMs) is also provided. The study begins with the general overview of human impacts on the water cycle. Then, the algorithms currently employed to represent irrigation, reservoir operation, and groundwater pumping are discussed. Next, methodological deficiencies in current modeling approaches and existing challenges are identified. Furthermore, light is shed on the sources of uncertainties associated with model parameterizations, grid resolution, and datasets used for forcing and validation. Finally, representing human land–water management in LSMs is highlighted as an important research direction toward developing integrated models using ESM frameworks for the holistic study of human–water interactions within the Earths system.

   abstract = {Riverine ecosystem protection requires the maintenance of natural flow and sediment regimes downstream from dams. In reservoir management schedules this requirement should be integrated with sedimentation control and human water supply. However, traditional eco-friendly reservoir operating methods have usually only considered the natural flow regime. This paper seeks to develop a reservoir operating method that accounts for both the natural flow and sediment regimes as well as optimizing the water supply allocations. Herein, reservoir water level (RWL), sediment-occupied ratio of reservoir volume (SOR) and rate of change of SOR (RCSOR) are adopted as three triggers of a drawdown-flushing-based sediment management policy. Two different groups of reservoir operating rule curves (RORCs) are designed for sediment-flushing and non-sediment-flushing years, and the three triggers, RWL, SOR and RCSOR, are used to change the "static" RORCs to "dynamic" ones. The approach is applied to the Wangkuai Reservoir, China to test its effectiveness. This shows that the approach can improve the flexibility of reservoir operators to balance the reservoir management, water supply management and the flow and sediment needs of the downstream riverine ecosystem. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a quantitative estimation of the impact of reservoirs on discharge and irrigation water supply during the 20th century at global, continental, and river basin scale. Compared to a natural situation the combined effect of reservoir operation and irrigation extractions decreased mean annual discharge to oceans and significantly changed the timing of this discharge. For example, in Europe, May discharge decreased by 10%, while in February it increased by 8%. At the end of the 20th century, reservoir operations and irrigation extractions decreased annual global discharge by about 2.1% (930 km3 yr-1). Simulation results show that reservoirs contribute significantly to irrigation water supply in many regions. Basins that rely heavily on reservoir water are the Colorado and Columbia River basins in the United States and several large basins in India, China, and central Asia (e.g., in the Krishna and Huang He basins, reservoirs more than doubled surface water supply). Continents gaining the most are North America, Africa, and Asia, where reservoirs supplied 57, 22, and 360 km3 yr-1 respectively between 1981-2000, which is in all cases 40% more than the availability in the situation without reservoirs. Globally, the irrigation water supply from reservoirs increased from around 18 km3 yr-1 (adding 5% to surface water supply) at the beginning of the 20th century to 460 km3 yr-1 (adding almost 40% to surface water supply) at the end of the 20th century. The analysis is performed using a newly developed and validated reservoir operation scheme within a global-scale hydrology and vegetation model (LPJmL).

   abstract = {A global overview of dam-based impacts on large river systems shows that over half (172 out of 292) are affected by dams, including the eight most biogeographically diverse. Dam-impacted catchments experience higher irrigation pressure and about 25 times more economic activity per unit of water than do unaffected catchments. In view of projected changes in climate and water resource use, these findings can be used to identify ecological risks associated with further impacts on large river systems. Humans have extensively altered river systems through impoundments and diversions to meet their water, energy, and transportation needs. Today, there are 945,000 dams above 15 m high, capable of holding back 96500 km 3 of water (1), or about 15% of the total annual river runoff globally (2). Over 300 dams are defined as giant dams, which meet one of three criteria on height (9150 m), dam volume (915 million m 3), or reservoir storage (925 km 3) (3). The recently constructed Three Gorges Dam on the Chang Jiang (Yangtze) in China is the largest, 181 m high and with a reservoir storing 939 km 3 (4, 5). Although statistics summarizing the world_s large dams are available (3, 4, 6, 7), detailed multiscale data have not been synthesized globally. Catchment-scale impacts of dams on ecosystems are generally well known, with both upstream and downstream effects stemming from inundation, flow manipulation, and fragmentation (8-10). Inundation destroys terrestrial ecosystems and eliminates turbulent reaches, disfavoring lotic biota. It can cause anoxia, greenhouse gas emission, sedimenta-tion, and an upsurge of nutrient release in new reservoirs (6, 11, 12). Resettlement associated with inundation can result in adverse human health effects and substantial changes in land use patterns (13, 14). Flow manipulations hinder channel development, drain floodplain wetlands, reduce floodplain productivity, decrease dynamism of deltas, and may cause extensive modification of aquatic communities (15-18). Dams obstruct the dispersal and migration of organisms, and these and other effects have been directly linked to loss of populations and entire species of freshwater fish (19-21). The World Commission on Dams produced the most comprehensive review of dam impacts yet (22), with illustrative catchment-scale case studies. However, data were not available for a global analysis based on subcatchment-scale resolution, integrating hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic data. Such a synthesis is needed to understand the multiple spatial, temporal, and interactive impacts of dams. Here, we present a global overview of flow regulation and channel fragmentation in the world_s largest river systems, which comprise a total virgin mean annual discharge (VMAD, the discharge before any substantial human manipulations) of some 790,000 m 3 s j1 , or 60% of the world_s river runoff. We proceeded by (i) identifying 153 large river systems (LRSs) in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Australasia that we had not previously assessed (23), (ii) locating and gathering storage capacity data for their dams, (iii) quantifying channel fragmentation by dams, (iv) and quantifying flow regulation by relating storage capacity to discharge. We also updated these same data for 139 systems that we had previously assessed in the Northern Hemisphere (23), combined the two data sets for a total of 292 river systems, and, on the basis of these data, classified the river systems as either unaffected , moderately affected, or strongly affected (24). We were unable to assess rivers in most of Indonesia and a small part of Malaysia (because of a lack of reliable discharge data). We included irrigation data for all 292 LRSs and analyzed global distribution of impact relative to terrestrial biomes and economic activity. We defined an LRS as a system that has, anywhere in its catchment, a river channel section with a VMAD of Q350 m 3 s j1 (23, 25). By river system, we mean entire networks of stream and river channels interconnected by surface freshwater, from the headwaters to the sea (26). The 292 LRSs (table S1 and Fig. 1) drain 54% of the world_s land area. North and Central America contain more LRSs (88 total) than any other continent, but on average these systems contribute less water and have smaller catchment areas than do those of Asia, Africa, and South America. Of the 10 LRSs with highest discharge, 6 lie in Asia, 2 in South America, 1 in Africa, and 1 in North and Central America. The catchments of LRSs encompass at least some part of all 16 of the world_s nonmarine biomes as classified by Olson et al. (27) and 950% of 11 of these biomes, including 87% of all boreal forests and 83% of all flooded grasslands and savannahs. The biomes with least proportion of their surface area in LRSs are rock and ice (1%); mangroves (17%); and Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub (19%). In all, 72 LRSs span only one biome, whereas the Ganges-Brahmaputra system (AS-65) encompasses the widest diversity (10 biomes), followed by the Amazonas-Orinoco (SA-11; these rivers have a natural cross-channel), Amur (AS-20), Yenisei (AS-5), Zambezi (AF-6), and Indus (AS-73) systems, each spanning eight. Nearly half (139) of all LRSs (48%) remain unfragmented (28) by dams in the main channel , 119 systems (41%) have unfragmented tributaries, and 102 systems (35%) are completely unfragmented. Europe contains the smallest number of completely unfragmented LRSs (just three rivers in northwestern Rus-sia). The continent with the greatest number (35) of unfragmented LRSs is North and Central America, and the greatest proportion is in Australasia (74%). Twelve LRSs (9 in Eu-rope and 3 in the United States) have G25% of the main channel_s length left unfragmented. The greatest flow regulation (29) was for the Volta river system in Africa (AF-19, 428%). In North and Central America, both the Manicougan (NA-35) and Colorado (NA-70) systems are regulated 9250%, and in South America the most highly regulated system is the Rio Negro in Argentina (SA-22, 140%). The most highly regulated systems in Asia are the Shatt Al Arab (or Euphrates-Tigris) in the Middle East (AS-74, 124%) and the Mae Khlong in Thailand (AS-58, 130%). Flow regulation does not exceed 100% in any LRS in Europe or Australasia. A flow regulation of 100% indicates that the entire discharge of one year could be held back and released by the dams in the river system. The numbers of unaffected and strongly affected LRSs are roughly equal (120 and 104, respectively), whereas moderately affected systems represent just 23%, or 68 of the 292 LRSs (Fig. 1). Of the 10 LRSs with highest discharge, 6 are moderately affected and 4 are strongly affected. The world_s two largest discharges, the Amazonas-Orinoco and Congo, are moderately affected, and the third largest discharge, the Chang Jiang, is strongly affected (table S1).

They alter water fluxes at the land surface and impact surface water storage through water management regulations for diverse purposes such as irrigation, municipal water supply, hydropower generation, and flood control. Although most developed countries have established sophisticated observing systems for many variables in the land surface water cycle, long-term and consistent records of reservoir storage are much more limited and not always shared. Furthermore, most land surface hydrological models do not represent the effects of water management activities. Here, the contribution of reservoirs to seasonal water storage variations is investigated using a large-scale water management model to simulate the effects of reservoir management at basin and continental scales. The model was run from 1948 to 2010 at a spatial resolution of 0.258 latitude-longitude. A total of 166 of the largest reservoirs in the world with a total capacity of about 3900 km 3 (nearly 60% of the globally integrated reservoir capacity) were simulated. The global reservoir storage time series reflects the massive expansion of global reservoir capacity; over 30 000 reservoirs have been constructed during the past half century, with a mean absolute interannual storage variation of 89 km 3. The results indicate that the average reservoir-induced seasonal storage variation is nearly 700 km 3 or about 10% of the global reservoir storage. For some river basins, such as the Yellow River, seasonal reservoir storage variations can be as large as 72% of combined snow water equivalent and soil moisture storage.},

We quantified the difference between modeled and observed streamflows for one process-based and three statistical-transfer hydrologic models, none of which explicitly accounted for reservoir storage. Streamflow statistics representing low to high flows, seasonality, annual variability, and daily autocorrelation were examined at 1082 study basins across the conterminous USA. All models increasingly overpredict (or decreasingly underpredict) observed annual maximum flows with increasing storage. Correlations between absolute values of errors for low-flow statistics and storage are often larger in magnitude than those for signed errors—additional storage is associated with increases in model errors in both directions even when its overall effect in one direction is weak. The rate of increase in absolute values of model errors was nonlinear for most statistics. For low flows, model errors had a change point to larger errors at 48 days of reservoir storage (relative to long-term mean daily flow); mean and high flows had change points at 147 to 176 days. We present predicted-to-observed errors for nine streamflow statistics over a large range of reservoir storage to help modelers and users of modeled streamflow understand the amount of storage for which explicit reservoir modeling is needed.},

   abstract = {Many thousands of large dam reservoirs have been constructed worldwide during the last 70 years to increase reliable water supplies and support economic growth. Because reservoir storage measurements are generally not publicly available, so far there has been no global assessment of long-term dynamic changes in reservoir water volumes. We overcame this by using optical (Landsat) and altimetry remote sensing to reconstruct monthly water storage for 6695 reservoirs worldwide between 1984 and 2015. We relate reservoir storage to resilience and vulnerability and investigate interactions between precipitation, streamflow, evaporation, and reservoir water storage. This is based on a comprehensive analysis of streamflow from a multi-model ensemble and as observed at ca. 8000 gauging stations, precipitation from a combination of station, satellite and forecast data, and open water evaporation estimates. We find reservoir storage has diminished substantially for 23% of reservoirs over the three decades, but increased for 21%. The greatest declines were for dry basins in southeastern Australia (-29%), southwestern USA (-10%), and eastern Brazil (-9%). The greatest gains occurred in the Nile Basin (+67%), Mediterranean basins (+31%) and southern Africa (+22%). Many of the observed reservoir changes could be explained by changes in precipitation and river inflows, emphasizing the importance of multi-decadal precipitation changes for reservoir water storage. Uncertainty in the analysis can come from, among others, the relatively low Landsat imaging frequency for parts of the Earth and the simple geo-statistical bathymetry model used. Our results also show that there is generally little impact from changes in net evaporation on storage trends. Based on the reservoir water balance, we deduce it is unlikely that water release trends dominate global trends in reservoir storage dynamics. This inference is further supported by different spatial patterns in water withdrawal and storage trends globally. A more definitive conclusion about the impact of changes in water releases at the global or local scale would require data that unfortunately are not publicly available for the vast majority of reservoirs globally.},

   abstract = {Multireservoir operating policies are usually defined by rules that specify either individual reservoir desired (target) storage volumes or desired (target) releases based on the time of year and the existing total storage volume in all reservoirs. This paper focuses on the use of genetic search algorithms to derive these multireservoir operating policies. The genetic algorithms use real-valued vectors containing information needed to define both system release and individual reservoir storage volume targets as functions of total storage in each of multiple within-year periods. Elitism, arithmetic crossover, mutation, and 'en bloc' replacement are used in the algorithms to generate successive sets of possible operating policies. Each policy is then evaluated using simulation to compute a performance index for a given flow series. The better performing policies are then used as a basis for generating new sets of possible policies. The process of improved policy generation and evaluation is repeated until no further improvement in performance is obtained. The proposed algorithm is applied to example reservoir systems used for water supply and hydropower.},

Building a new reservoir is a common way to alleviate water shortage, but this comes at a great environmental cost. The South Korean government granted permission to add on a water supply function for the Hwacheon Reservoir, the largest hydropower reservoir in Korea, for the first time in the history. This study develops a new rule curve for the Hwacheon Reservoir to supply water and generate energy at the same time, considering the status of other reservoirs in the Han River basin. The simulation model uses two scenarios, with scenario 1 simulating historic operation and scenario 2 applying the deficit supply method. The new rule curve was formulated based on the results from scenario 2. Time-based and volumetric reliability increased by 33% and 4%, respectively, and resiliency more than doubled compared to the historic reservoir operation. This is the first case study in South Korea that demonstrates how to successfully integrate a water supply function into an existing hydropower reservoir. This study can be applied and extended to other river basins in an attempt to alleviate water shortages by adding new functions to existing reservoirs.},

   abstract = {During the past several decades, numerous reservoirs have been built across the world for a variety of purposes such as flood control, irrigation, municipal/industrial water supplies, and hydropower generation. Consequently, the timing and magnitude of natural streamflow have been altered significantly by reservoir operations. In addition, the hydrological cycle is also modified by land-use/land-cover change and by climate change. To understand the fine-scale feedback between hydrological processes and water management decisions, a distributed hydrological model embedded with a reservoir component is desired. In this study, a multi-purpose reservoir module with predefined complex operational rules was integrated into the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). Conditional operating rules, which are designed to reduce flood risk and enhance water supply reliability, were adopted in this module. The performance of the integrated model was tested over the upper Brazos River Basin in Texas, where two U.S. Army Corps of Engineers managed reservoirs, Lake Whitney and Aquilla Lake, are located. The integrated model was calibrated and validated using observed reservoir inflow, outflow, and storage data. The error statistics were summarized for both reservoirs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Using the weekly reservoir storage for Lake Whitney as an example, the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.85 and the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) was 0.75. These results suggest that this reservoir module holds promise for use in sub-monthly hydrological simulations. With the new reservoir component, the DHSVM provides a platform to support adaptive water resources management under the impacts of evolving anthropogenic activities and substantial environmental changes.},

   abstract = {Reservoirs significantly affect flow regimes in watershed systems by changing the magnitude and timing of streamflows. Failure to represent these effects limits the performance of hydrological and land-surface models (H-LSMs) in the many highly regulated basins across the globe and limits the applicability of such models to investigate the futures of watershed systems through scenario analysis (e.g., scenarios of climate, land use, or reservoir regulation changes). An adequate representation of reservoirs and their operation in an H-LSM is therefore essential for a realistic representation of the downstream flow regime. In this paper, we present a general parametric reservoir operation model based on piecewise-linear relationships between reservoir storage, inflow, and release to approximate actual reservoir operations. For the identification of the model parameters, we propose two strategies: (a) a "generalized" parameterization that requires a relatively limited amount of data and (b) direct calibration via multi-objective optimization when more data on historical storage and release are available. We use data from 37 reservoir case studies located in several regions across the globe for developing and testing the model. We further build this reservoir operation model into the MESH (Modélisation Environmentale-Surface et Hydrologie) modeling system, which is a large-scale H-LSM. Our results across the case studies show that the proposed reservoir model with both parameter-identification strategies leads to improved simulation accuracy compared with the other widely used approaches for reservoir operation simulation. We further show the significance of enabling MESH with this reservoir model and discuss the interdependent effects of the simulation accuracy of natural processes and that of reservoir operations on the overall model performance. The reservoir operation model is generic and can be integrated into any H-LSM.},

Applying this daily timestep regulation routine at 19 reservoirs in the Arctic Ocean watershed, performance is shown to improve upon the reservoir regulation currently available in the HYPE model when testing outflow and storage Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies (NSEs). Improvements stem from intra-annually variable storage rule curves and a variety of stage-dependent outflow functions, improving simulation skill (median NSE increases of 0.18 over 21 reservoir outflow records and 0.49 over 19 reservoir storage records).

These models rely on generic reservoir release schemes that often fail to capture the nuances of operations at individual dams. Here we assess whether empirically derived release-availability functions tailored to individual dams could improve the simulation performance of an LHM. Seasonally varying, linear piecewise relations that specify water release as a function of prevailing storage levels and forecasted future inflow are compared to a common generic scheme for 36 key reservoirs of the Columbia River Basin. When forced with observed inflows, the empirical approach captures observed release decisions better than the generic scheme—including under conditions of drought. The inclusion of seasonally varying inflow forecasts used by reservoir operators adds further improvement. When exposed to biases and errors inherent in the LHM, data-driven policies fail to offer a robust improvement; inclusion of forecasts deteriorates LHM reservoir simulation performance in some cases. We perform sensitivity analysis to explain this result, finding that the bias inherent in LHM streamflow is amplified by a reservoir model that relies on forecasts. To harness the potential of interpretable, data-driven reservoir operating schemes, research must address LHM flow biases arising from inaccuracies in climate input, runoff generation, flow routing, and water withdrawal and consumption data.},

Changing values for balancing environmental resources, multisectoral human system pressures, and more frequent climate extremes are increasing the complexity of operational decision making. Today, reservoir operations benefit from technological advances, including improved monitoring and forecasting systems as well as increasing computational power. Past research in this area has largely focused on improving solution algorithms within the limits of the available computational power, using simplified problem formulations that can misrepresent important systemic complexities and intersectoral interactions. In this study, we review the recent literature focusing on how the operation design problem is formulated, rather than solved, to address existing challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper contributes a comprehensive classification of over 300 studies published over the last years into distinctive categories depending on the adopted problem formulation, which clarifies consolidated methodological approaches and emerging trends. Our analysis also suggests that control policy design methods may benefit from broadening the types of information that is used to condition operational decisions, and from using emulation modeling to identify low-order, computationally efficient surrogate models capturing realistic representations of river basin systems' complexity in order to isolate key decision-relevant processes. These advances in reservoir operations hold significant promise for better addressing the challenges of conflicting human pressures and a changing world, which is particularly important, given the renewed interest in dam construction globally.},

   abstract = {Reservoirs have been built worldwide to address the water-related issues. To fully understand their potential impacts on the hydrologic regime, explicitly parameterizing reservoir operation in hydrologic models is often required. In this study, two data-driven reservoir operation schemes based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and artificial neural network (ANN) are respectively developed to predict the reservoir release and storage in hydrologic models for reservoirs with historic in-situ inflow, storage, release data. Then, a hybrid modelling framework is proposed by coupling a high-resolution (3 km) hydrologic model with (1) the developed data-driven reservoir operation schemes and (2) a calibration-free conceptual reservoir operation scheme designed for data-scarce reservoirs. This allows quantitative assessment of the cumulative impacts of dam operation on the hydrologic regime under different reservoir data availability. The framework is applied to the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) in China that is one of the most regulated river basins across the country due to extensive reservoir construction. Results indicate that both data-driven reservoir operation schemes can well reconstruct the reservoir releases and storage in the UYRB (daily NSE of ∼ 0.9), and the XGBoost performs slightly better than ANN. By coupling reservoir operation, the model shows a remarkably improved performance in reconstructing the daily streamflow of the basin. The major reservoirs in the UYRB can redistribute excessive water in the wet season to the dry season and attenuate the high and low flows, leading to enhanced water security along the river. Our approach provides a practical framework for reservoir impact assessment and predictions.},

First, a standalone RMM is developed to simulate daily release and storage during Water Year 1981–2015. Next, using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the ML technique, a standalone LSTM model is trained based on reservoir inflow and meteorological observations to simulate reservoir release and estimate reservoir storage through water balance calculation. Three hybrid modeling strategies are developed, one using RMM output as an additional LSTM input (H1), another using LSTM as the initial release estimate in RMM (H2), and the third combining the first two strategies (H3). The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for release (NSE-r), storage (NSE-s), and their mean (NSE-avg) are used for model evaluation. Overall, H1 improves NSE-r to 0.65 and 0.54 for Allatoona and Lanier, respectively, compared to standalone RMM (0.44 and 0.21); however, its storage trajectory did not produce a physically feasible solution, similar to LSTM. H2 and especially H3 show that they can retain the best features from RMM and LSTM, with H3 NSE-avg being 0.695 and 0.55 for Allatoona and Lanier outperforming RMM (0.615 and 0.29).

Using an artificial neural network capable of mimicking fuzzy logic, called the ANFIS adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system, fuzzy rules linking inflow and storage with reservoir release were determined for 11 reservoirs in central Asia, the US and Vietnam. By varying the input variables of the neural network, different configurations of fuzzy rules were created and tested. It was found that the release from relatively large reservoirs was significantly dependent on information concerning recent storage levels, while release from smaller reservoirs was more dependent on reservoir inflows.

Here we introduce a new dataset of bespoke water storage and release policies for 1,930 reservoirs of conterminous United States. The Inferred Storage Targets and Release Functions (ISTARF-CONUS) dataset relies on a new inventory of observed daily reservoir operations (ResOpsUS) to generate reservoir operating rules for 595 data-rich reservoirs. These functions are developed in a standardized form that allows for extrapolation of operating schemes to 1,335 data-scarce reservoirs—leading to the first inventory of empirically derived reservoir operating policies for all large CONUS reservoirs documented in the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRanD) database. Evaluation of the new scheme in daily simulations forced with observed inflow demonstrates substantial and robust improvement for both release and storage relative to the popular Hanasaki method. Performance of the extrapolation approach for data-scarce reservoirs is evaluated with leave-one-out validation and is shown to also offer modest gains on average over Hanasaki.
